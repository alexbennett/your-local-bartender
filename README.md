# Your Local Bartender

 Your Local Bartender is a virtual assistant integrated into a Discord server. It can do all of the fun things modern LLMs can do, like generate images, read and respond to messages, and even join voice channels for real-time conversation. The bot can also leverage many parts of the Discord Bot API to assist with moderation, user management, server management, and more. 

## Command Reference

Simply mention the bot by its name in any message with your request. Otherwise, use the following commands:

- `>join`: Joins the voice channel of the user who issued the command.
